                    This simple and beginner-friendly page will give you some pointers and help you understand a few important HTML tags and CSS properties. This is not a full HTML/CSS tutorial, but it will point out a few key tags/properties as well as show you to some great videos/pages for tutorials.

                       An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document.

                       As part of an HTML element, HTML tags help web browsers convert HTML documents into web pages. For example, the "p" tag is used to organize text content into paragraph elements and the "img" tag is used to embed image elements.
                    </li>
					 <li>
                      HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as e lements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).

            <header>The P tag</header>
            <article>
                <p>The "P" HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

		<section class="main-section" id="The_A_tag">
            <header>The A tag</header>
			<p>The "a" HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. Content within each "a" should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the "a" element will activate it.

            <article>
                <p>The "span" HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. "span" is very much like a "div" element, but "div" is a block-level element whereas a "span" is an inline element.

            <header>CSS Background</header>
            <article>
                <p>The background shorthand CSS property sets all background style properties at once, such as color, image, origin and size, or repeat method. The background property is specified as one or more background layers, separated by commas.
				<br>	
				<p>The property background-size allows us to reset the width and height of our image according to screen size. Background-position allows us to tell the browser where to put the image on the screen.</p>

            <article>
                <p>The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the font-family that is currently set.

            <header>CSS Color</header>
            <article>
                <p>The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.
				<br>
				<p>All modern browsers support the following 140 color names.</p>
